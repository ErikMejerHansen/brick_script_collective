# Things I learned about Phoenix

## Javascript/Typescript integration is so easy

* `npm --save` in `assets/vendor` just works
* Adding Typescript to `assets/js` just works
* Super helpful error messages 😍

> Could not resolve "foo"
> 
> Use the relative path "./foo" to reference the file "js/foo.ts". Without the leading "./", 
>  the path "foo" is being interpreted as a package path instead.

* Live Reload works for JS as well

#### Lesson: Have seperate project for complex js builds, then import _that_!

## Section

* There is a symmetry between the "joined" and "leaved" structure you get in presence_diff messages and `stream_delete_by_dom_id` and `stream_insert`
